Project Overview\
This project utilizes the Boston Housing dataset to predict median house prices based on various housing and neighborhood features. The project implements Linear Regression as the predictive model and evaluates its performance using several statistical metrics.\

Foundations\
Dataset:\
The Boston Housing dataset contains information on housing values in suburbs of Boston. Each observation provides details like the number of rooms, crime rates, proximity to employment centers, and more.\

Problem Statement:\
The goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on predictor variables. Understanding these relationships can help identify key factors influencing housing prices.\

Project Objectives\
Understand the relationships between housing features and prices.\
Build a predictive model using Linear Regression.\
Evaluate model performance with metrics like R-squared, MSE, and RMSE.\
Gain insights into the most influential factors affecting housing prices.\
\
\
Libraries Used
NumPy: For numerical computations.\
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.\
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.\
Scikit-learn: For preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.\
Statsmodels: For detailed statistical summaries of the regression model.\
\
\
Key Steps
1. Data Loading\
Dataset: Boston Housing dataset (available in Scikit-learn's datasets module or external sources).\
Load the dataset and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.\
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
Understand the structure of the dataset, including features and target variables.\
Visualize relationships using:\
Scatter plots\
Correlation heatmaps\
Pair plots\
Check for missing values or anomalies.\
3. Feature Selection\
Identify features highly correlated with the target variable (MEDV).\
Perform feature scaling if necessary (e.g., Standardization or Normalization).\
4. Model Building\
Statsmodels: Fit an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model for statistical analysis.\
Scikit-learn: Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model for prediction.\
5. Model Evaluation\
Key Metrics:\
R-squared and Adjusted R-squared: Proportion of variance explained by the model.\
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measure prediction accuracy.\
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): Provide accuracy in percentage terms.\
Visualize residuals to check for homoscedasticity and validate model assumptions.\
6. Insights and Conclusion\
Analyze the importance of features based on regression coefficients.\
Discuss strengths and limitations of the model.\
Suggest improvements, such as feature engineering or advanced models like Ridge/Lasso Regression.\
